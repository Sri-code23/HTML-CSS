## Introduction to HTML
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It is the backbone of a website, providing the structure and content that the web browser renders to the user.

## Basic HTML Structure
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>
  <!-- content here -->
</body>
</html>
```
This is the basic structure of an HTML document.

## Headings
HTML has six levels of headings, which are defined by the `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<h4>`, `<h5>`, and `<h6>` tags.
```html
<h1>Heading 1</h1>
<h2>Heading 2</h2>
<h3>Heading 3</h3>
<h4>Heading 4</h4>
<h5>Heading 5</h5>
<h6>Heading 6</h6>
```
Output:
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6

## Paragraphs
The `<p>` tag is used to define a paragraph of text.
```html
<p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
```
Output:
This is a paragraph of text.

## Links
The `<a>` tag is used to define a hyperlink.
```html
<a href="https://www.example.com">Visit example.com</a>
```
Output:
Visit example.com

## Images
The `<img>` tag is used to define an image.
```html
<img src="image.jpg" alt="An image">
```
Output:
An image will be displayed.

## Lists
There are two types of lists in HTML: ordered lists and unordered lists.

### Ordered Lists
The `<ol>` tag is used to define an ordered list.
```html
<ol>
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
  <li>Item 3</li>
</ol>
```
Output:
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3

### Unordered Lists
The `<ul>` tag is used to define an unordered list.
```html
<ul>
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
  <li>Item 3</li>
</ul>
```
Output:
• Item 1
• Item 2
• Item 3

## Tables
The `<table>` tag is used to define a table. It is a block-level element that is used to display data in a structured format. Tables consist of rows and columns, and each intersection of a row and column is called a cell.

```html
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Column 1</th>
    <th>Column 2</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Cell 1</td>
    <td>Cell 2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Cell 3</td>
    <td>Cell 4</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```

Output:
| Column 1 | Column 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Cell 1   | Cell 2   |
| Cell 3   | Cell 4   |

### Table Structure

A table consists of the following elements:

* `<table>`: The table element is the container for the table.
* `<tr>`: The table row element is used to define a row in the table.
* `<th>`: The table header element is used to define a header cell in the table.
* `<td>`: The table data element is used to define a data cell in the table.

### Table Attributes

The `<table>` element has several attributes that can be used to customize its appearance and behavior. Some of the most commonly used attributes include:

* `border`: This attribute is used to specify the border width and style of the table.
* `cellpadding`: This attribute is used to specify the amount of space between the cell contents and the cell border.
* `cellspacing`: This attribute is used to specify the amount of space between cells.
* `width`: This attribute is used to specify the width of the table.

### Table Styles

Tables can be styled using CSS to customize their appearance. Some common styles include:

* `background-color`: This property is used to specify the background color of the table.
* `border-color`: This property is used to specify the border color of the table.
* `border-style`: This property is used to specify the border style of the table.
* `border-width`: This property is used to specify the border width of the table.

### Example Use Cases

Tables can be used to display a wide range of data, including:

* Financial data, such as budgets and invoices
* Scientific data, such as experimental results and statistical analysis
* Product information, such as product features and specifications
* Event schedules, such as conference programs and meeting agendas

### Best Practices

When using tables, it's a good idea to follow these best practices:

* Use tables to display data that is best presented in a structured format.
* Use the `<th>` element to define header cells, and the `<td>` element to define data cells.
* Use the `border`, `cellpadding`, and `cellspacing` attributes to customize the appearance of the table.
* Use CSS to style the table and its contents.

## Forms
The `<form>` tag is used to define a form. It is a block-level element that is used to collect user input and submit it to a server for processing.

```html
<form>
  <label for="name">Name:</label>
  <input type="text" id="name" name="name"><br><br>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
```

Output:
A form with a text input and a submit button.

### Form Structure

A form consists of the following elements:

* `<form>`: The form element is the container for the form.
* `<label>`: The label element is used to define a label for a form control.
* `<input>`: The input element is used to define a form control, such as a text input or a checkbox.
* `<textarea>`: The textarea element is used to define a multi-line text input.
* `<select>`: The select element is used to define a dropdown list.

```

### Input Styles

Input fields can be styled using CSS to customize their appearance. Some common styles include:

* `background-color`: This property is used to specify the background color of the input field.
* `border-color`: This property is used to specify the border color of the input field.
* `border-style`: This property is used to specify the border style of the input field.

* Use CSS to style the input field and its contents.

```html
<!-- Example of a well-structured input field -->
<label for="email">Email:</label>
<input type="email" name="email" id="email" required>
```

### Semantic HTML

Semantic HTML is a way of writing HTML that emphasizes the meaning of the content, rather than its presentation. It uses tags that describe the content, such as `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, `<footer>`, etc.

```html
<!-- Example of a semantic HTML structure -->
<header>
  <nav>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
      <li><a href="#">About</a></li>
      <li><a href="#">Contact</a></li>
    </ul>
  </nav>
</header>
<main>
  <section>
    <h1>Welcome to our website</h1>
    <p>This is a sample website.</p>
  </section>
</main>
<footer>
  <p>&copy; 2023 Our Company</p>
</footer>
```

### Block and Inline Elements

Block elements take up the full width of the page and start on a new line. Inline elements take up only the space needed to display their content and do not start on a new line.

```html
<!-- Example of block and inline elements -->
<p>This is a paragraph of text.</p> <!-- block element -->
<span>This is a span of text.</span> <!-- inline element -->
```

```css
/* Example of styling block and inline elements with CSS */
p {
  background-color: #f2f2f2;
  padding: 10px;
}

span {
  font-weight: bold;
  color: #00698f;
}
```

## Div and Span

The `<div>` and `<span>` elements are two of the most commonly used elements in HTML. They are used to group elements together and apply styles to them.

### Div Element

The `<div>` element is a block-level element that is used to group elements together and apply styles to them. It is a generic container element that can be used to wrap around other elements.

```html
<!-- Example of a div element -->
<div>
  <h1>Welcome to our website</h1>
  <p>This is a sample website.</p>
</div>
```

### Span Element

The `<span>` element is an inline element that is used to group elements together and apply styles to them. It is a generic container element that can be used to wrap around other elements.

```html
<!-- Example of a span element -->
<p>This is a paragraph of text with a <span>span of text</span> inside it.</p>
```

### Styling Div and Span Elements

Div and span elements can be styled using CSS to customize their appearance. Some common styles include:

* `background-color`: This property is used to specify the background color of the element.
* `border-color`: This property is used to specify the border color of the element.
* `border-style`: This property is used to specify the border style of the element.
* `border-width`: This property is used to specify the border width of the element.
* `padding`: This property is used to specify the padding of the element.
* `margin`: This property is used to specify the margin of the element.

```css
/* Example of styling a div element with CSS */
div {
  background-color: #f2f2f2;
  border-color: #ccc;
  border-style: solid;
  border-width: 1px;
  padding: 10px;
  margin: 20px;
}

/* Example of styling a span element with CSS */
span {
  font-weight: bold;
  color: #00698f;
}
```

### Example Use Cases

Div and span elements can be used in a wide range of scenarios, including:

* Creating a container element to group other elements together
* Applying styles to a group of elements
* Creating a layout for a web page
* Adding a background image or color to a section of a web page

```html
<!-- Example of using a div element to create a container -->
<div class="container">
  <h1>Welcome to our website</h1>
  <p>This is a sample website.</p>
</div>

<!-- Example of using a span element to add a background image -->
<p>This is a paragraph of text with a <span class="highlight">span of text</span> inside it.</p>
```

```css
/* Example of styling the container div element with CSS */
.container {
  background-color: #f2f2f2;
  border-color: #ccc;
  border-style: solid;
  border-width: 1px;
  padding: 10px;
  margin: 20px;
}

/* Example of styling the highlight span element with CSS */
.highlight {
  background-image: url('highlight.png');
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  padding: 5px;
}
```

### Best Practices

When using div and span elements, it's a good idea to follow these best practices:

* Use div elements to group block-level elements together
* Use span elements to group inline elements together
* Use CSS to style div and span elements
* Avoid using div and span elements to add unnecessary structure to a web page
* Use semantic HTML elements instead of div and span elements when possible

## Id and Class

The `id` and `class` attributes are used to specify a unique identifier and a class name for an HTML element.

### Id Attribute

The `id` attribute is used to specify a unique identifier for an HTML element. It is used to identify a specific element in a document, and it must be unique within the document.

```html
<!-- Example of an id attribute -->
<p id="paragraph1">This is a paragraph of text.</p>
```

### Example of HTML Entities

```html
<!-- Example of an HTML entity -->
<p>This is a paragraph of text with a &lt;span&gt; element.</p>
```

In this example, the `&lt;` entity is used to represent the less-than sign (<), and the `&gt;` entity is used to represent the greater-than sign (>).

### List of Common HTML Entities

Here is a list of common HTML entities:

* `&lt;` - less-than sign (<)
